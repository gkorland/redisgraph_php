# redisgraph_php
A client for RedisGraph aiming to track its development and implementation of OpenCypher.

NOTE: The project is at an early stage and still has some issues to solve before being considered as an MVP. The code is offered as-is, but I plan on actively developing and maintaining it.
Contributions are welcome!
